# Validator-Automatic-Failover
This page and associated Python scripts, detail a method for automating the failover of a Radix validator.  Huge thanks to Daan (Krulknul) for his contribution of the Mnemonic derivation which means that the validator owner badge can be retained in the mobile wallet, rather than held in a solely programmatic account.

All tools are provided for free to the Radix community, but if they are of benefit to you and you'd like to show some appreciation/fund further developments, please feel free to stake a little XRD on [Radstakes](https://dashboard.radixdlt.com/network-staking/validator_rdx1sds4prpgf0p25pu458fg468nw9rtwqdawwg9w45hgf0t95yd3ncs09) or send a couple of pints' worth of XRD to `account_rdx12yugeppnu2sul2qnry7nscpc9aglm922ygzkvvplp37p3rwvr4z7xz`
